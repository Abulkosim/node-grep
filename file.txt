In the corner of the living room, an old rocking chair sits patiently, collecting morning sunlight and forgotten stories. Across the street, a little bookstore sits wedged between a bakery and a music shop, its bell chiming every so often as curious visitors wander in. While time races hurriedly outside, a sense of calm sits at the kitchen table, sipping quietly from a mug of tea. Somewhere a cat finds the last patch of sunlight and sits, surveying its small kingdom with regal indifference.
