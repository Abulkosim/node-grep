John Doe sent an email to jane_smith@example.com with the subject “Server logs for build #349”. 
The email mentioned that the latest deployment to production took place at 03:42 AM.
However, two warnings appeared in the logs: 
1) Deprecated API call detected in /src/utils/helpers.js line 128. 
2) Missing environment variable: DB_CONNECTION_URL.

Later that day, a commit (hash: 9f3d2c1b) was pushed to the repository “osiris-backend”. 
The commit message read: “Fixed env variable issue and updated documentation.” 
The associated JIRA ticket was OSR-1429.
